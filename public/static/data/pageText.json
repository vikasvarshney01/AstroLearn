This visualization uses data provided by the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) and [Keplerian equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation) to determine the positions of planets and satellites at any given time. It is inspired by *The Orrery* by C. C. Foster and [100,000 Stars](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/100000-stars) by the Google Data Arts team.\n\n## Instructions\n\n* Use your mouse, trackpad, or touch screen to orbit around a visual.\n* Click on a planet or satellite label to focus on it, and click on the visual name to see information on it.\n* To zoom, scroll or pinch the screen, or move the vertical slider located on the left.\n* Change the date of the visualization using the calendar on the top right corner, and use the **Speed Scale** to inflate time.\n* Use the **Planet Scale** slider to change the size of the planets and their satellites.\n* Toggle the sound by clicking the volume bars on the bottom left.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis visualization doesn't account for astronomical anomalies (such as aberrations from other celestial objects) so accuracy is only guaranteed within few hundred years from the current.\n\n## Credits\n\n.\n* Planetary ephemerides courtesy of [NASA](https://jpl.nasa.gov/) and the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.nasa.gov/).\n* Ambient music [*Ultra Deep Field*](https://soundcloud.com/stellardrone/stellardrone-ultra-deep-field) by [Stellardrone](https://soundcloud.com/stellardrone).\n\n*For Teaching about space science.*"
